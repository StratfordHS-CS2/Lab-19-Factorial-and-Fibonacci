# Lab 19 - Factorial and Fibonacci

In this lab you will be taking the pseudocode algorithms you wrote in the *Fibonacci and Factorial Pseudocode* assignment and will be implementing them in Python.

### Instructions ###

1. Copy your pseudocode algorithm for computing the Factorial into main.py as a block comment.
2. Below your algorithm, translate your pseudocode into working code.
3. After you get it working (example input & output are provided below), answer the question in the block comment below your code.

### Factorial ###

Sample Input | Expected Output
-------------|----------------
0 | 1
1 | 1
2 | 2
3 | 6
4 | 24
5 | 120
10 | 3628800

### Fibonacci Sequence ###

These are the first 29 numbers in the Fibonacci Sequence.

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811`
